# Bitbucket Cloud build status notifier plugin for Jenkins

This Jenkins plugin is simply a fork of original [Bitbucket Cloud build status notifier plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-build-status-notifier-plugin) at version [1.4.1](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-build-status-notifier-plugin/releases/tag/1.4.1)

Please refer to documentation of original plugin for additional information


## Features (of Fork)

The original plugin does not have the option to provide custom build URL while updating build status in Bitbucket
This might not always be a problem unless you want custom portal or code analysis tool to be destination of your build status depending on the type of failure

The fork has simply added buildURL as extra parameter, which falls back to original functionality if the buildUrl is not provided


## Dependencies
This plugin depends on other Jenkins plugins, please refer to documentation of original plugin


## Instructions

### Create a OAuth Consumer
First you need to get a OAuth consumer key/secret from Bitbucket.

1. Login into your Bitbucket account.
2. Click your account name and then in **Settings** from the menu bar.
3. Click **OAuth** from the menu bar.
4. Press the **Add consumer** button.
6. The system requests the following information:
 1. Give a representative **name** to the consumer e.g. Jenkins build status notifier.
 2. Although is not used, a **Callback URL** must be set e.g. ci.your-domain.com.
 2. Leave blank the **URL** field.
 3. Add **Read** and **Write** permissions to **Repositories**.
 4. Click **Save** button and a **Key** and **Secret** will be automatically generated.

### Ensure Jenkins URL is set
Second, ensure that Jenkins URL is properly set:

1. Open Jenkins **Manage Jenkins** page.
2. Click **Configure System** page.
3. Got to the section **Jenkins Location**.
4. Set correct URL to **Jenkins URL**.
5. Click **Save** button.

### Add OAuth Credentials to Jenkins
Third, you need to add the Bitbucket OAuth Consumer credentials. You have two ways to configure it globally or locally:

#### Global

1. Open Jenkins **Manage Jenkins** page.
2. Click **Configure System**.
3. Go to the section **Bitbucket Build Status Notifier plugin**
4. If you still don't have stored the credentials click **Add**, otherwise you can skip this step.
 1. Select **Username with password**.
 2. Set the the OAuth consumer **key** in **Username**.
 3. Set the the OAuth consumer **secret** in **Password**.
 4. Click **Add** button.
5. Select the desired credentials.
6. Click **Save** button.

#### Local

1. Go to the Job you want notifies the builds to Bitbucket.
2. Click **Configure**.
3. Click **Add post-build action**.
4. Select **Bitbucket notify build status**.
5. Click **Advanced** button.
6. If you still don't have stored the credentials click **Add**, otherwise you can skip this step.
 1. Select **Username with password**.
 2. Set the the OAuth consumer **key** in **Username**.
 3. Set the the OAuth consumer **secret** in **Password**.
 4. Click **Add** button.
7. Select the desired credentials.

### Pipeline step to notify Bitbucket

Once you have configured the credential, you can notify BitBucket from your Pipeline script through the `bitbucketStatusNotify` step.

#### Usage

The `bitbucketStatusNotify` step notifies the status of a build identified by a build key and build name to BitBucket.
If `buildKey` and `buildName` parameters are not provided, a standard name will be assigned to the build (NameOfYourJob #numberOfBuild - eg. MyProject #32).

```groovy
  ...  
    try {
        myTestFunction()
        bitbucketStatusNotify(
          buildState: 'SUCCESSFUL',
          buildKey: 'test',
          buildName: 'Test',
          buildUrl: "${MyNonCIURL}", //Or this could simply be "http://www.google.com"
          repoSlug: 'my-awesome-project',
          commitId: 'a83c709e9d514421ef614ef0a1117366c84c6304'
        )
    } catch(Exception e) {
        bitbucketStatusNotify(
          buildState: 'FAILED',
          buildKey: 'test',
          buildName: 'Test',
          buildUrl: "${MyNonCIURL}", //Or this could simply be "http://www.google.com"
          buildDescription: 'Something went wrong with tests!',
          repoSlug: 'my-awesome-project',
          commitId: 'a83c709e9d514421ef614ef0a1117366c84c6304'
        )
    }
  ...
```
